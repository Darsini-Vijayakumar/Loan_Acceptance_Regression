# Loan_Acceptance_Regression
Regression models for predicting customer conversion behavior

---------------------------------------------

**1. Project Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately determine the likelihood of a bank's clients accepting a personal loan offer. The goal is to aid the bank in effectively targeting potential loan customers, optimizing marketing strategies, and improving customer service by personalizing offers based on individual profiles.

**2. Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a fictional universal bank and contains data of 1117 clients. The data includes several demographic and financial attributes such as Age, Experience, Income, Family size, Average credit card spending (CCAvg), Education level, Mortgage value, and whether the client has a certificate of deposit (CD) account, uses online banking services, has a credit card, and whether they accepted a personal loan offer.

**3.Approach**
The analysis begins with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. The data is then split into training and test sets. Various machine learning models are explored for this classification problem, including Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as F1-score, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

**4. Results**
Results detail the performance of each model tested, comparing their effectiveness based on accuracy, F1-score, and other relevant metrics. Insights from the confusion matrix and classification reports are used to discuss the models' strengths and weaknesses in predicting loan acceptance. The best-performing model is highlighted as the recommended solution for the bank to implement.
